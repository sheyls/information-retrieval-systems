theoretical and experimental evidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a model, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition .  this model may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in detail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a reasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities . in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes of problems ..  a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/ class, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction . for the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the shock layer region between the shock and the body is fully viscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer are small at the shock wave boundary .  here, the use of the navier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given by the hugoniot relations is justified .  for the merged layer class, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes equations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock structure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary conditions .  a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/ conditions where the shock may no longer be considered an infinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened sufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis .  in this case we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying conservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses, and heat conduction . for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for both the viscous and merged layer class of problems .  solutions of these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow problems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to illustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations have been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the assumption of constant density

approximation . results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear, and heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled sphere flying at hypersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds number, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above the extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer regime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime . as the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static and stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease . calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with decreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy behind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they are higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the stagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy . for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the same quantities are presented as for the sphere .  the increase found in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated boundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction theory . a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental data for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and the behavior predicted by the results of the present

rarefied gas flow . this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous aerodynamic characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and at sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free path becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer theory but not so large that free molecule concepts apply . results of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to define the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of continuum theory .  based on theoretical and experimental evidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a model, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition .  this model may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in detail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a reasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities . in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes of problems ..  a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/ class, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction . for the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the shock layer region between the shock and the body is fully viscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer are small at the shock wave boundary .  here, the use of the navier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given by the hugoniot relations is justified .  for the merged layer class, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes equations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock structure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary conditions .  a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/ conditions where the shock may no longer be considered an infinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened sufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis .  in this case we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying conservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses, and heat conduction . for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for both the viscous and merged layer class of problems .  solutions of these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow problems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to illustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations have been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the assumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful approximation at hypersonic speeds .  to illustrate the merged layer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere using the incipient merged layer approximation . results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear, and heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled sphere flying at hypersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds number, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above the extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer regime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime . as the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static and stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease . calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with decreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy behind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they are higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the stagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy . for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the same quantities are presented as for the sphere .  the increase found in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated boundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction theory . a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental data for viscous flow quantities in the

distributions showed that both laminar and turbulent local rates can be predicted by available theories /given the pressure distribution about the body/ reasonably well, although the scatter of the available data still leaves open the choice between the theories at the edge of the bodies, where they usually differ . tests on a flat-faced cylinder at a mach number of 2.49 and at angles of attack

knowledge of a wide range of subjects from pure acoustics at one hand to metal physics at the other . at the present time the various aspects of the problem are not sufficiently well know quantitatively for a purely theoretical design study to be made . never- the-less a knowledge of the behaviour of typical forms of construction in noise environments can be used with a limited amount of theoretical work to indicate tne most efficient types of structure . this approach to the problem is adopted in this lecture as it seems to be the most promising one available at the moment . it must be emphasized, however, that although some progress has been made in dicsovering the behaviour of a structure subjected to noise it is not possible to estimate the life of any component at the drawing board stage . some prototype strain measurements and proof testing are therefore essential if one is to prove the integrity of the design . within the structural limits of single skin construction set in this lecture the main conclusion to be reached is that no reasonable estimate of fatigue life can yet be made in the drawing board stage of a structure . nevertheless, a study of the form of behaviour of typical structures has led to a theoretical simplification of the problem of skin vibration . from this it has been possible to suggest an optimum deisgn for a skin stiffened by stringers . a suggestion for an optimum design of skin and rib for control surfaces to minimise stresses at the rib-skin intersection is put forward but no experience can check this yet . the most resonable basis for the future estimation of fatigue life of a component appears to be the /random/ s-n curve and consierable effort should be made to obtain the necessary test data . the life

velocity field associated with the laminar axisymmetric jet flow of a compressible gas with an arbitrary but constant external flow .  the approximate solution is shown to be in good agreement with the exact numerical calculation of pai . in many boundary layer problems it is not possible to make the assumption of flow similarity .  the solution in these cases can be obtained either by laborious finite difference techniques or by resort to approximate solutions .  carrier and lewis (1), and more recently carrier (2), have suggested a method of obtaining approximate solutions to problems involving convection and diffusion .  this method, termed by carrier /the modified-oseen method/, overcomes an essential difficulty of integral methods, namely, the generation of reasonable profiles .  it is well known that the integral method gives accurate results only if the analytical profiles represent closely the true profiles .  according to the modified-oseen method the convective operator in the original partial differential equation is replaced by a linear one .  the resulting equation for the boundary layer problem is the heat conduction equation which can be treated by well-known techniques . it is the purpose of this paper to indicate a modification of this procedure and to demonstrate its simplicity and accuracy by treating the axisymmetric laminar flow of a compressible gas with arbitrary but constant external flow .  the modification is based on the use of the von mises transformation with a subsequent linearization of the viscous term, rather than the linearization of
